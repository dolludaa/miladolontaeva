                <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                <p>In this project, I conducted a behavioral and demographic analysis based on customer data from a retail business. The goal was to identify value-driving segments, understand product/channel performance, and inform marketing and engagement strategies. The final Tableau story included three dashboards:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Segment Overview</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Purchase & Channel Behavior</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>High-Value Segment Deep Dive</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>Key Insights and Recommendations</h3>
                
                <h4>Customer Value and Segments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customers with no children consistently spend more</strong> than other groups, averaging over $1,000 per person.</li>
                    <li><strong>Households without kids are the most responsive</strong> to campaigns and more likely to buy premium categories (wine, meat, gold).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Product Strategy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wine is the highest-value product:</strong> $680,816 total revenue and $304 per customer — more than 11× the spend on sweets or fruits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gold has lower volume but shows strong value per buyer,</strong> making it ideal for targeted promotions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Channel Performance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web channel is the most stable over time,</strong> maintaining average purchases across recency groups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Store dominates in volume but decays faster</strong> in retention, while Catalog shows sharp drop-off.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>Analytical Process</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Understanding the Business Task</h4>
                <p>The main business objectives were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify high-spending and high-response customer segments</li>
                    <li>Understand how demographic traits influence behavior</li>
                    <li>Connect product/channel trends to segment structure</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Guiding questions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who are our highest-value customers?</li>
                    <li>How does family size impact product mix?</li>
                    <li>Which channels deliver consistent engagement?</li>
                    <li>What product categories yield highest revenue per user?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Data Preparation and Cleaning</h4>
                <p>The dataset included demographics, campaign response, product spend, and transactional info.</p>
                <p><strong>I performed all data cleaning and structuring in Excel before loading into Tableau.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Key cleaning steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Merged child/teen counts into a single "Family Type" column</li>
                    <li>Created three family segments: Full Family, Small Family, No Kids</li>
                    <li>Grouped birth years into age bins</li>
                    <li>Unified education and marital status categories</li>
                    <li>Removed customers with $0 spend</li>
                    <li>Aggregated 6 campaign response flags into a simplified "Response" field</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Data Analysis and Visualization</h4>
                <p>Once cleaned, I imported the dataset into Tableau and built a story containing three dashboards:</p>
                
                <h5><strong>1. Segment Overview</strong></h5>
                <p>This dashboard introduced core distributions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marital status and age (most customers are 40–65; high response in 25–35 and 70+)</li>
                    <li>Education vs. Income (PhD and Master's have higher income and stronger campaign acceptance)</li>
                    <li>Family Type split: Small Families (50%) dominate volume; No Kids (28%) dominate spend.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5><strong>2. Purchase & Channel Behavior</strong></h5>
                <p>Here I focused on how segments behave:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Spending by Product:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wine leads with $680,816 in total sales</li>
                    <li>Meat is second with $373,968 and $167 per user</li>
                    <li>Gold shows premium potential ($44/user on average)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Channel Use & Recency:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web shows stable purchase patterns across all recency buckets</li>
                    <li>Store has 42% more transactions than Web, but is more sensitive to recency</li>
                    <li>Catalog fades quickly, suggesting low retention</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>65% of users made 10 or fewer purchases</li>
                    <li>Frequent buyers (>20 purchases) are under 7% of base</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5><strong>3. High-Value Segment Deep Dive</strong></h5>
                <p>This dashboard isolates "No Kids" as the most valuable segment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avg. spend: $1,097</li>
                    <li>Highest response rate</li>
                    <li>Strongest use of Web + Store</li>
                    <li>Preference for wine ($487 avg.) and meat ($373)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Full Families spent the least (~$500) and leaned toward fish, sweets, and offline channels.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This project demonstrates that <strong>customer value is not spread evenly — it's concentrated in specific structural segments.</strong> Notably, households without children deliver higher revenue, stronger marketing response, and more consistent behavior over time.</p>
                
                <h4>Recommendations:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Target the No Kids segment</strong> with premium offers and retention campaigns</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the Web channel</strong> as a stable re-engagement vector</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce reliance on Catalog,</strong> especially for dormant users</li>
                    <li><strong>Promote high-margin products</strong> like wine and gold to top-performing segments</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Strategic Focus:</strong> Instead of optimizing for total volume, strategy should prioritize value-per-customer and behavioral stability, both of which are strongest in the No Kids group.</p>
