                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Overall Findings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cyber risk is no longer limited to certain industries or attack types</li>
                        <li>Phishing grew the fastest (30%+) and financial losses became almost equal across all sectors</li>
                        <li>What matters most is the vulnerability being exploited, not where or how the attack happens</li>
                        <li>Weak passwords, zero-day exploits, social engineering, and unpatched software are the main entry points</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Strategic Recommendations</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strengthen password security</strong> with MFA, regular rotation, and strict complexity rules</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement continuous patch management</strong> to close unpatched software gaps quickly</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain 24/7 monitoring</strong> and rapid response for zero-day exploits</li>
                        <li><strong>Deploy advanced phishing protection,</strong> including AI-based email filtering and user training</li>
                        <li><strong>Build DDoS mitigation capacity</strong> that can scale during peak attack periods</li>
                        <li><strong>Use unified incident response processes</strong> that work for all attack types and sources</li>
                        <li><strong>Track vulnerability trends</strong> and adjust security priorities at least quarterly</li>
                        <li><strong>Share threat intelligence</strong> across industries to detect and block cross-sector campaigns early</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Final Insight:</strong> Cyber risk today is global, repeating in cycles, and equally dangerous for everyone. To reduce future losses, especially before the expected 2027 surge, organizations must focus on fixing core weaknesses, reacting faster, and keeping defenses ready for all major threats.</p>
