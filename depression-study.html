                <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                <p>I analyzed a CSV dataset of 27,901 student responses to explore which academic, lifestyle, and psychological factors correlate most strongly with self-reported depression.</p>

                <h4>My process:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cleaned mislabeled and inconsistent city entries in Excel</li>
                    <li>Removed invalid responses and non-geographic data</li>
                    <li>Focused on key variables: academic pressure, satisfaction, sleep, suicidal thoughts</li>
                    <li>Visualized key insights in Tableau dashboards</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key findings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Depressed students are not disengaged — they're overloaded and emotionally burned out</li>
                    <li>50% of depressed students reported suicidal thoughts vs. 13% in the non-depressed group</li>
                    <li>Sleep extremes (<5h or >8h) and unhealthy diets are more common in the depressed group</li>
                    <li>Gender shows no major effect, while city-level variation suggests location-specific stress</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project stood out to me because I've long been interested in how academic and emotional pressure affect students, especially in fast-paced environments.</p>
                <p>When I came across this publicly available dataset of nearly 28,000 student mental health responses, I saw an opportunity to explore those stress patterns through data.</p>

                <p>I wasn't aiming to build a predictive model — my goal was to find clear, interpretable signals of depression: emotional, behavioral, environmental.<br>
                Visual storytelling helped turn raw CSV data into structured insight, allowing me to highlight risk areas that could guide awareness or future intervention.</p>

                <h4>I followed a six-step analytical workflow:</h4>
                <ul class="workflow-steps">
                    <li>Ask</li>
                    <li>Prepare</li>
                    <li>Clean</li>
                    <li>Analyze</li>
                    <li>Share</li>
                    <li>Conclude</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>1. Ask</h3>
                <p>What measurable factors distinguish depressed students from non-depressed ones?</p>
                <p>The central goal was to surface which academic conditions, habits, or psychological traits are consistently associated with reported depression — not just correlations, but patterns strong enough to inform action.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>2. Prepare & Clean</h3>
                <h4>Dataset Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>27,901 records from anonymized student surveys</li>
                    <li>Key fields included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Demographics: gender, city</li>
                            <li>Academic: CGPA, pressure (1–5), satisfaction (1–5)</li>
                            <li>Lifestyle: daily study/work hours, sleep range, diet type</li>
                            <li>Psychological: suicidal thoughts, family mental illness</li>
                            <li>Target label: Depression_Status (Depressed / Not Depressed)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Structuring for Analysis</h4>
                <p>To compare multiple behavioral and academic factors across student mood groups, I reorganized the dataset into a long format. Each row represents a single response linked to one factor, such as academic pressure, study satisfaction, work hours, or financial stress.</p>
                <p>Each factor was either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scored on a 0–5 scale (for pressure, satisfaction, and stress), or</li>
                    <li>Recorded as numeric input (for study/work hours)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This structure allowed me to calculate average values for each factor by mental state and visualize the results side-by-side in Tableau. It also made it easier to apply filters and groupings dynamically while keeping the dashboard structure clean and scalable.</p>
                <img src="public/images/pivot_table.png" alt="Pivot Table Structure" class="pivot-table-image" loading="lazy">

                <h4>Dual Dataset Strategy</h4>
                <p>While the pivoted dataset was optimal for factor-based comparisons, some analyses required student-level records in a wide format — with each attribute in its own column.</p>
                <p>To address this, I maintained two separate versions of the data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wide format: used for gender-based distributions, depression breakdowns, and lifestyle comparisons (e.g., sleep, diet)</li>
                    <li>Long format: used for analyzing stress-related academic attributes with grouped bar charts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This dual-format setup gave me flexibility in Tableau — ensuring each insight used the most suitable structure, without compromising clarity or visual integrity.</p>
                <img src="public/images/data_set.png" alt="Dual Dataset Structure" class="pivot-table-image" loading="lazy">

                <h4>Cleaning Steps</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>City cleanup:
                        <p>To ensure reliable geographic analysis, I created a reference list of valid Indian cities. Using Excel formulas (TRIM, LOWER, COUNTIF), I normalized all city entries and compared them against the official list. Non-matching values — including personal names, degrees, or invalid strings — were flagged as "Unrecognized" and excluded from geographic visualizations.</p>
                        <img src="public/images/cleaned_cities.png" alt="City Cleanup Process" class="cleaned-cities-image" loading="lazy">
                    </li>
                    <li>Zero-variance columns:
                        <p>Two fields (Job Satisfaction, Work Pressure) contained only zero values. These were excluded.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Category normalization:
                        <p>Sleep durations like "<5 hours", ">8 hours", and diet labels like "moderate" or "unhealthy" were normalized to use consistent phrasing. This ensured categorical filters worked correctly in Tableau.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Partial records:
                        <p>For each visualization, I included only rows with complete values for the variables being compared.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Tools used:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Excel for cleaning</li>
                    <li>Tableau for visualization</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Interpretation: Depressed students put in more effort but feel it doesn't pay off. The pattern reflects burnout, not disengagement.</p>

                    <li>Overview: depression rate and gender breakdown</li>
                    <li>Academic Load: pressure, hours, satisfaction</li>
                    <li>Mental Risk Factors: suicidal thoughts, family history</li>
                    <li>Sleep & Diet: behavioral variables</li>
                    <li>City View: mapped depression rates by location</li>
                    <li>Gender Comparison: focused gender analysis</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The data shows that student depression is a consistent response to a specific set of pressures. Students who report being depressed are not doing less — they are doing more: studying longer, reporting higher academic pressure, and yet feeling less satisfied. The average difference in study time exceeds 1.5 hours per day, and pressure scores are 54% higher. At the same time, satisfaction drops noticeably, indicating that effort is not translating into positive academic experience.</p>
                
                <p>This imbalance is not just emotional — it becomes behavioral. Sleep patterns are disrupted in both directions, with depressed students much more likely to fall outside the stable 6–8 hour range. Psychological strain is reflected in hard numbers: half of depressed students report suicidal thoughts, nearly four times the rate in the non-depressed group.</p>
                
                <p>No significant differences were found by gender, but city-level variation reached up to 15 percentage points, which suggests that environmental and institutional context play a larger role than individual characteristics.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, the analysis confirms that depression in students is a structural outcome, not a random or isolated condition. The consistency of these patterns across thousands of responses shows exactly where risk accumulates and where attention should be focused. The data does not just describe the problem — it defines its shape.</p>
